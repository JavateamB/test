# Library Checkout System  

## Project Overview  
The **Library Checkout System** is a Java-based console application designed to help users efficiently manage library inventory records. This system allows users to checkout different books, search for different books in the library, add books to a list, and view the current list of unavailable inventory. The program is structured to be simple yet scalable, making it a great starting point for a larger program. Since this project is a console-based application, all interactions occur through a text-based menu system, and data is stored in memory during runtime. Future improvements may include file-based storage for persistence, category organization, and user authentication to enhance usability.  
   

## Features  
- Checkout books that are available  
- Search for specific books  
- Add books to a list  
- View the list of checked out books  
- Console-based interface (no GUI or database)

1) implementing JavaDocs
     * Javadocs is a tool that alows us a more specific form of documentation and communication. With it, we can use special tags to describe classes, methods, fields, constructors, etc.
     * It requires a specific style of block comment that starts with /** and ends with */. In between is the range where you can comment.
     * Inside that range ^^^, describe the code and what it does (method, field, etc.) --> use tags to document details like parameters and return values

Tags: 
@author (Classes and interfaces only)
@version (Classes and interfaces only)
@param (Methods and Constructors only)
@return (Methods only)
@exception (can also use @throws)
@see
@since
@serial 
@deprecated

These tags are similar to hyperlinks. As we write our code, we can reference other parts of it, helping us stay organized and relay information quicker and smoother.
