# Library Checkout System  

## Project Overview  
The **Library Checkout System** is a Java-based console application designed to help users efficiently manage library inventory records. This system allows users to checkout different books, search for different books in the library, add books to a list, and view the current list of unavailable inventory. The program is structured to be simple yet scalable, making it a great starting point for a larger program. Since this project is a console-based application, all interactions occur through a text-based menu system, and data is stored in memory during runtime. Future improvements may include file-based storage for persistence, category organization, and user authentication to enhance usability.  
   

## Features  
- Checkout books that are available  
- Search for specific books  
- Add books to a list  
- View the list of checked out books  
- Console-based interface (no GUI or database)
